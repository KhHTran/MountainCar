# MountainCar
Using Neural Network to approximate the value of the Q-table for the Mountain Car problem created by OpenAI. 
The problem documentation can be found at: https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/MountainCar-v0 
The solution use the base rewards given by the environment.

The other notebook contain a solution for the ContinuousMountainCar-v0 problem.
The problem documentation can be found at: https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/ContinuousMountainCar-v0
The solution use the approach of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient published in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf
